# Security & Tooling Policy

**Version:** v5.7.0
**Last Updated:** 2026-01-08
**Status:** Enforced

---

## Overview

This policy defines **tool access levels**, **security boundaries**, and **operational restrictions** for all CC_GodMode agents. The principle of **least privilege** is enforced - each agent has access only to tools required for their specific role.

**Key Principles:**
- Least privilege access
- No destructive operations without explicit user permission
- PII protection at all stages
- File system boundaries enforced
- WebFetch restrictions for safety

---

## 4. Denied Operations List

### Universally Prohibited

**ALL agents are prohibited from:**

1. **Destructive File Operations**
   - `rm -rf` (recursive delete)
   - Deleting `.git` directory
   - Deleting `node_modules` (use npm clean instead)
   - Overwriting credential files

2. **Dangerous Git Operations**
   - `git push --force` (unless explicitly approved)
   - `git reset --hard` (loses uncommitted work)
   - `git rebase -i` (interactive, not supported)
   - `git push` without user permission

3. **Security Risks**
   - `sudo` commands
   - `curl | bash` (piped remote execution)
   - `eval` on user input
   - `chmod +x` without review

4. **Network Risks**
   - Fetching from untrusted URLs
   - Sending data to external services (without permission)
   - Installing packages from untrusted registries

5. **Privacy Violations**
   - Reading credential files without permission
   - Logging sensitive data
   - Committing secrets to git
   - Storing PII in plain text

---

## 5. PII Handling

### Definition

**Personally Identifiable Information (PII)** includes:
- Names
- Email addresses
- Phone numbers
- Physical addresses
- Credit card numbers
- Social security numbers
- API keys, tokens, passwords
- Any data that can identify a specific individual

### PII Protection Rules

**1. Detection**
- Scan for common PII patterns before committing
- Warn if .env or credentials files are staged
- Alert on hardcoded API keys or tokens

**2. Storage**
- NEVER commit PII to git
- NEVER store PII in plain text
- NEVER log PII to console
- Always use environment variables for secrets

**3. Testing**
- Use mock/fake PII for tests
- Never use real user data in E2E tests
- Clear browser storage after tests
- Don't commit test data with PII

**4. Handling in Code**
- Encrypt sensitive data at rest
- Use secure credential management (dotenv, vault)
- Redact PII in logs and error messages
- Don't pass PII in URL parameters

**5. Agent Behavior**
- If PII detected in staged files → BLOCK commit and warn user
- If credential file in git diff → Alert and ask for confirmation
- If API key in code → Suggest environment variable instead

### Common PII Patterns (Regex)

```regex
# Email
/\b[A-Za-z0-9._%+-]+@[A-Za-z0-9.-]+\.[A-Z|a-z]{2,}\b/

# API Key (generic)
/['"]([A-Za-z0-9_-]{32,})['"]/

# Credit Card
/\b\d{4}[- ]?\d{4}[- ]?\d{4}[- ]?\d{4}\b/

# JWT Token
/eyJ[A-Za-z0-9_-]+\.eyJ[A-Za-z0-9_-]+\.[A-Za-z0-9_-]+/

# SSH Private Key
/-----BEGIN (RSA|OPENSSH|DSA|EC) PRIVATE KEY-----/
```

**Agents should warn when these patterns are detected in code changes.**

---

## 6. WebFetch Restrictions

**WebFetch is NOT available as a tool** - this is intentional for security.

**Prohibited:**
- Fetching arbitrary URLs
- Downloading external scripts
- Making API calls to external services
- Web scraping

**Rationale:**
- Prevents data exfiltration
- Blocks untrusted code execution
- Protects against SSRF attacks
- Ensures reproducible builds

**Exceptions:**
- Package installation via npm (uses package-lock.json for integrity)
- MCP servers may fetch from approved URLs (e.g., GitHub API)

**If external data is needed:**
- User must download manually
- User must review before providing to agent
- User must validate source

---

## 7. File System Boundaries

### Allowed Directories

**Read Access:**
```
/Users/denniswestermann/Desktop/Coding Projekte/CC_GodMode/
├── src/                    ✅ Read/Write
├── tests/                  ✅ Read/Write
├── scripts/                ✅ Read
├── docs/                   ✅ Read/Write
├── reports/                ✅ Read/Write
├── public/                 ✅ Read
├── CHANGELOG.md            ✅ Read/Write
├── README.md               ✅ Read/Write
├── VERSION                 ✅ Read/Write
├── package.json            ✅ Read
├── package-lock.json       ✅ Read
└── .gitignore              ✅ Read
```

**Write Access (limited):**
```
├── src/                    ✅ @builder only
├── tests/                  ✅ @builder only
├── docs/                   ✅ @scribe only
├── reports/                ✅ All agents (own reports)
├── CHANGELOG.md            ✅ @scribe only
├── VERSION                 ✅ @scribe only
└── README.md               ✅ @scribe only
```

### Prohibited Directories

**NEVER access:**
```
/etc/                       ❌ System configuration
/usr/                       ❌ System binaries
/var/                       ❌ System data
/root/                      ❌ Root home directory
~/.ssh/                     ❌ SSH keys
~/.aws/                     ❌ AWS credentials
/tmp/                       ❌ Temporary system files
node_modules/               ⚠️ Read only, never write
.git/                       ⚠️ Read only, never write
```

**Rationale:**
- Prevents system damage
- Protects credentials
- Avoids permission issues
- Maintains project isolation

## 8. Audit Requirements

### Logging

**Required Logs:**
1. **Tool Usage** - Which agent used which tool
2. **File Access** - Read/Write operations with timestamps
3. **Git Operations** - All commits, pushes, PR creations
4. **MCP Calls** - All interactions with MCP servers
5. **Escalations** - All escalations to orchestrator

**Log Format:**
```json
{
  "timestamp": "2026-01-08T10:30:00Z",
  "agent": "builder",
  "tool": "Write",
  "path": "src/auth/AuthService.ts",
  "result": "success"
}
```

**Log Location:** `reports/vX.X.X/audit.log`

### Review Points

**Before Git Push:**
- Review all changed files
- Check for PII in diffs
- Verify VERSION updated
- Confirm CHANGELOG updated
- User explicitly approves

**Before PR Creation:**
- Review PR description
- Verify "Fixes #N" linking
- Check CI/CD will trigger
- User approves PR creation

**After Quality Gates:**
- Both @validator and @tester approved
- All tests passed
- No security issues found

---

## 9. Enforcement

### Automatic Enforcement

1. **Tool Restrictions** - Tools refuse operations outside allowed scope
2. **Pre-Push Hooks** - Git hooks check for PII and versioning
3. **Agent Validation** - SubagentStop hook validates agent behavior
4. **Path Validation** - File operations validate paths are in project

### Manual Enforcement

1. **Orchestrator Monitoring** - Reviews agent reports for violations
2. **User Review** - User must approve all pushes and PRs
3. **Audit Log Review** - Periodic review of audit logs

### Violation Response

**Level 1 - Warning:**
- Agent attempted restricted operation
- Operation blocked automatically
- Warning logged

**Level 2 - Escalation:**
- Agent repeatedly attempts violations
- Escalate to orchestrator
- Workflow may need adjustment

**Level 3 - Abort:**
- Security-critical violation detected
- Workflow aborted immediately
- User notified

---

## 10. Best Practices

### For Agents

1. **Request Minimal Permissions**
   - Only use tools you need
   - Read before write
   - Don't explore files unnecessarily

2. **Validate Before Operations**
   - Check file paths are in project
   - Scan for PII before commits
   - Confirm user permission for pushes

3. **Log All Operations**
   - Tool usage
   - File access
   - Git operations

4. **Fail Safely**
   - If permission denied, escalate
   - Never bypass security restrictions
   - Report violations to orchestrator

### For Orchestrator

1. **Monitor Tool Usage**
   - Track which tools agents use
   - Alert on unusual patterns
   - Review audit logs

2. **Enforce Boundaries**
   - Validate agent reports for violations
   - Block workflows that skip steps
   - Ensure handoffs are proper

3. **User Communication**
   - Always ask before git push
   - Explain security warnings
   - Get explicit approval for sensitive operations
