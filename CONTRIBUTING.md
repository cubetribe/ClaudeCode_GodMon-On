# Contributing to CC_GodMode 🤝

First of all: **Thank you!** Being here means you either:
- a) Found a bug
- b) Have a brilliant idea
- c) Got lost

For all three cases: Welcome!

---

## 🐛 Reporting Bugs

1. **Check first** if the bug hasn't already been reported (search Issues)
2. **Open an Issue** with:
   - What you expected
   - What happened instead
   - Your environment (OS, Claude Code version, Node version)
   - Steps to reproduce
3. **Bonus points** for screenshots or logs

### Template:

```markdown
**What should happen:**
The @validator should find all consumers.

**What happens instead:**
It finds only half of them and then takes a lunch break.

**Environment:**
- macOS 14.x
- Claude Code 1.x.x
- Node 20.x

**Steps to reproduce:**
1. ...
2. ...
3. Despair
```

## 💡 Feature Requests

Do you have an idea how CC_GodMode can become even better?

1. **Open an Issue** with the label `enhancement`
2. Describe:
   - The problem you want to solve
   - Your proposed solution
   - Alternatives you've considered

No idea is too wild. Except maybe "Claude should also make me coffee". That doesn't work (yet).

## 🎨 Code Style

### Markdown (Agents, Docs)

- Use `##` for main sections
- Code blocks with language annotation (```bash, ```typescript)
- Tables for structured data
- Emojis are allowed (but don't overdo it)

### JavaScript (Scripts)

- Use ES6+ features
- Comments for complex logic
- Don't forget error handling
- No external dependencies (only Node built-ins)

---

## 🧪 Testing

Before creating a PR:

1. **Test the installation** (YOLO and Safe Mode)
2. **Test the agents** in a real project
3. **Test the hooks** with different file paths

### Quick Test Checklist

- [ ] Installation runs through
- [ ] Agents are recognized
- [ ] Hooks trigger for API files
- [ ] Reports land in `Agents/`
- [ ] Nothing explodes
