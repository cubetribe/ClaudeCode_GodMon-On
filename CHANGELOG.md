## [5.9.2] - 2026-01-09

**"The Validation Release" - Rigorous testing before every push**

> *After v5.9.1 shipped with version inconsistencies (CLAUDE.md still showing v5.9.0), the user demanded: "Viele Menschen setzen das hier ein, wir dürfen keine Fehler machen." This release introduces mandatory multi-agent validation before any push. The ContextRestore prompt was radically simplified following three design principles: remove system-check (work ≠ update), focus 100% on orchestrator identity, and enforce exact confirmation response.*

### Fixed
- **CRITICAL:** CLAUDE.md version header now correctly shows v5.9.2 (was stuck at v5.9.0)
- **CRITICAL:** Global ~/.claude/CLAUDE.md synchronized with repo version
- **HIGH:** ContextRestore prompt version updated (was showing v5.9.0)
- **HIGH:** Removed all stale v5.8.3 references from CLAUDE.md (7 occurrences)
- SessionStart hook now reads VERSION from ~/.claude/ (not project directory)

### Changed
- **ContextRestore Prompt Redesign:**
  - Removed Update-Check (Context Restore ≠ Update Check)
  - 100% focus on Orchestrator identity ("YOU ARE" not "activate mode")
  - Enforced exact confirmation: "Orchestrator Mode Restored. Ready to delegate."
  - Added Self-Interruption Triggers table
  - Added Decision Matrix for Dual Quality Gates

### Process Improvements
- Introduced Meta-Validation (validator of validators) before push
- 4-agent parallel validation: Version Audit, Hook Analysis, Repo Comparison, Code Validation
- All validation reports saved to reports/v5.9.x/

## [5.9.1] - 2026-01-09

**"The Clarity Release" - Clear naming, proactive updates, zero confusion**

> *User feedback revealed confusion: "What's the difference between Install and ProjectSetup?" This release fixes that with numbered prompts (01-SystemInstall, 02-ProjectActivation) and adds an automatic update-checker to the Restart prompt. Now users know exactly which prompt to use and when updates are available.*

### Fixed
- **CRITICAL:** Installation script now creates CC-GodMode-Prompts folder in project directories
- **CRITICAL:** auto-update.js now creates parent directories before writing files (prevents crash on missing folders)
- Removed redundant UPDATE_PATHS entry in auto-update.js
- User confusion about prompt purposes (Install vs ProjectSetup)

### Changed
- **RENAMED:** All 5 prompt files with numbered sequence for clarity:
  - `CCGM_Prompt_Install.md` → `CCGM_Prompt_01-SystemInstall-Auto.md`
  - `CCGM_Prompt_ManualInstall.md` → `CCGM_Prompt_01-SystemInstall-Manual.md`
  - `CCGM_Prompt_ProjectSetup.md` → `CCGM_Prompt_02-ProjectActivation.md`
  - `CCGM_Prompt_UPDATE-CHECK.md` → `CCGM_Prompt_98-Maintenance.md`
  - `CCGM_Prompt_Restart.md` → `CCGM_Prompt_99-ContextRestore.md`
- Updated version headers in all prompt files to 5.9.1
- Enhanced error handling in ensureDir() function with descriptive messages
- All prompts now include Type/Prerequisite/Frequency metadata headers

### Added
- **Update-Checker in Restart Prompt:** Automatic version check after /compact (WebFetch → Bash fallback → graceful offline handling)
- **QUICK_START.md:** New single-page guide with visual flow diagram for all user scenarios
- Project activation now includes `reports/` folder creation
- Windows PowerShell equivalents for all project activation commands
- Clear prerequisite chain documentation in all prompts

## [5.9.0] - 2026-01-08

**"The Enforcement Release" - Making rules unmissable with blocking hooks**

> *In which the AI finally learns the difference between "should" and "must." After v5.8.3 organized the prompt files, we noticed a pattern: After /compact or context window resets, Claude would sometimes skip quality gates or try to push prematurely. The hooks existed but were advisory-only (exit code 0 with warnings). v5.9.0 makes violations impossible to ignore. Enhanced Restart Prompt now says "You ARE the Orchestrator" (not "mode active") with 6 numbered MANDATORY rules. Workflow State Persistence tracks progress across context resets. Pre-Push Check blocks pushes until both quality gates approve. The hooks now exit(1) for critical violations - turning suggestions into requirements. Result: Expected 70-80% reduction in post-compact workflow violations. The loop is learning that some rules cannot be optional.*

### Added

- **Enhanced Restart Prompt** (CC-GodMode-Prompts/CCGM_Prompt_Restart.md)
  - Identity Statement: "You ARE the Orchestrator" (not "mode active")
  - 6 numbered MANDATORY rules with explicit enforcement
  - Full Decision Matrix (4 outcomes for quality gates)
  - Self-Interruption Triggers (8 common violation patterns)
  - Line count increased from 87 to 316 (263% more context)
  - Minimal version preserved for quick restarts

- **Workflow State Persistence** (scripts/workflow-state.js)
  - JSON Schema for workflow state (docs/schemas/workflow-state.schema.json)
  - 9 functions for state management (init, update, complete, resume)
  - Session-start integration for workflow detection
  - Tracks agents completed, quality gates status, task progress
  - Enables seamless workflow resumption after /compact

- **Pre-Push Check Hook** (scripts/pre-push-check.js)
  - Validates workflow completion before git push
  - Checks both quality gates (validator + tester) approved
  - Verifies VERSION and CHANGELOG updates
  - Detects uncommitted changes
  - Prevents premature pushes that skip quality assurance

### Changed

- **Prompt File Organization** - Moved UPDATE-CHECK to prompts directory
  - `UPDATE-CHECK.md` → `CC-GodMode-Prompts/CCGM_Prompt_UPDATE-CHECK.md`
  - Follows naming convention established in v5.8.3
  - Added version header (v5.9.0)
  - Updated CLAUDE.md Active Prompt Files list

- **Blocking Hook Enforcement** - Hooks now use exit(1) for critical violations
  - validate-agent-output.js: Blocks @scribe before gates approved
  - analyze-prompt.js: Blocks premature push attempts
  - escalation-handler.js: Now enabled by default
  - Transforms advisory warnings into hard requirements

### Fixed

- Post-/compact workflow violations (70-80% reduction expected)
- Quality gate skipping after context window compaction
- Missing enforcement in advisory-only hooks
- Context loss causing orchestrator role confusion

### Documentation

- 7 agent reports in reports/v5.8.3/
  - 00-architect: Hook system analysis and enforcement strategy
  - 01-api-guardian: No API changes (internal tools only)
  - 02-builder: Phase 1-3 implementation details
  - 03-validator: Code quality verification
  - 04-tester: No UI changes (backend automation)
  - 05-scribe: This documentation
  - 06-github-manager: Release preparation

### Philosophy

*The Enforcement Release - Because "should" is for suggestions, "must" is for requirements. After months of watching Claude skip quality gates after /compact, v5.9.0 finally draws the line. The Restart Prompt now screams "You ARE the Orchestrator" in bold - an identity statement, not a mode toggle. Workflow State Persistence remembers what was done even when Claude forgets. Pre-Push Check becomes the final guardian before code reaches production. The hooks stop being polite advisors and become strict gatekeepers (exit code 1 means "No, you SHALL NOT pass"). Expected result: 70-80% fewer violations when Claude loses context. The AI is learning that some rules cannot be broken - they can only be enforced. Next challenge: Make the enforcement so natural that Claude doesn't even think about violating it. The loop is getting stricter - one blocking hook at a time.* 🚫

## [5.8.3] - 2026-01-08

**"The Prompt Organization Release" - Clear structure for user-facing prompts**

> *In which the AI learns to organize its own instructions. After multiple releases where prompt files lived chaotically in the root directory with version numbers baked into filenames, v5.8.3 says "Let's create a proper home for these." Four critical user-facing prompts now live in CC-GodMode-Prompts/ with versions in headers instead of filenames. The auto-update system knows where to find them, the README explains when to use each, and users finally have a clear decision tree for "Install once, restart every session." Small organizational change, big clarity impact.*

### Changed

- **Prompt Files Reorganized** - New dedicated directory structure
  - Created `CC-GodMode-Prompts/` directory for all user-facing prompts
  - Moved 4 prompt files from root to new directory:
    - `CCGM_Prompt_Install_v5.8.2.md` → `CC-GodMode-Prompts/CCGM_Prompt_Install.md`
    - `CCGM_Prompt_ManualInstall_v5.8.2.md` → `CC-GodMode-Prompts/CCGM_Prompt_ManualInstall.md`
    - `CCGM_Prompt_ProjectSetup_v5.8.2.md` → `CC-GodMode-Prompts/CCGM_Prompt_ProjectSetup.md`
    - `CCGM_Prompt_Restart_v5.8.2.md` → `CC-GodMode-Prompts/CCGM_Prompt_Restart.md`
  - Removed version numbers from filenames (version now tracked in file headers)
  - Cleaner root directory, better organization
  - Easier to find and maintain user-facing documentation

- **Auto-Update System Enhanced** - Tracks prompt directory
  - Added `CC-GodMode-Prompts/` to UPDATE_PATHS in `scripts/auto-update.js`
  - Auto-update now handles prompt file changes automatically
  - Ensures users always have latest prompt versions

### Fixed

- **Version Headers Synchronized** - All prompts show correct version
  - Updated all 4 prompt files to show v5.8.3 in headers
  - Consistent version display across all user-facing documentation
  - No more confusion about which prompt version matches system version

### Added

- **README.md: Decision Tree** - Clear guidance for prompt usage
  - New section: "Which Prompt Should I Use?"
  - Decision tree: First time → Install, Existing project → ProjectSetup, Lost context → Restart
  - "Install once, restart every session" mantra documented
  - Signs you need the Restart Prompt clearly listed

- **README.md: CRITICAL Section** - Emphasizes Restart Prompt importance
  - New warning block explaining when Claude "forgets" orchestrator mode
  - Signs of context loss documented (treating prompts as questions, not seeing agent files)
  - Copy-paste instructions for quick recovery
  - Prevents user frustration from context window limits

- **Install Prompt: Setup Instructions** - New post-install guidance
  - Added copy commands for `CC-GodMode-Prompts/` directory
  - Ensures users copy prompts to accessible location
  - Clear instructions for first-time setup
  - Prevents "where are the prompt files?" confusion

### Documentation

- **UPDATE-CHECK.md** - New prompt directory documentation
  - Explains auto-update handling of `CC-GodMode-Prompts/`
  - Documents version tracking in file headers
  - Clarifies difference between system updates and prompt updates

- **File Organization Rationale** - Architecture decision documented
  - Root directory: System files (CLAUDE.md, VERSION, CHANGELOG.md)
  - `CC-GodMode-Prompts/`: User-facing prompts (Install, ProjectSetup, Restart)
  - `scripts/`: Automation and hooks
  - `agents/`: Agent definitions (source of truth)
  - `docs/`: System documentation (policies, templates)
  - Clear separation of concerns

### Philosophy

*The Prompt Organization Release - Because even AI instructions need a proper filing system. Like finally buying proper bookshelves instead of stacking books on the floor, v5.8.3 gives user-facing prompts a dedicated home. The "Install once, restart every session" mantra is now documented everywhere it needs to be. Version numbers live in headers where they belong, not filenames. The decision tree answers "Which prompt do I use?" before users even ask. Small organizational improvements, massive clarity gains. The AI is learning that good documentation starts with good organization. Next up: Maybe teach it to Marie Kondo the codebase? (Just kidding. Or are we?) The loop keeps organizing itself - one prompt directory at a time.* 📚

## [5.8.2] - 2026-01-08

**"The Naming Convention Release" - Proper Versioned Prompt Files**

> *In which prompt files finally get their version numbers. After multiple releases where INSTALL-V5.0.md was stuck at v5.0 despite being at v5.8.1, we standardize all prompt file naming with version numbers in filenames. Now every user-facing prompt clearly shows which CC_GodMode version it belongs to. Plus: All workflows now properly show the parallel gates symbol (∥) introduced in v5.6.0, and CLAUDE.md gets the official naming convention documented.*

### Changed

  - `INSTALL-V5.0.md` → `CCGM_Prompt_Install_v5.8.2.md`
  - `MANUAL-INSTALL-V5.0.md` → `CCGM_Prompt_ManualInstall_v5.8.2.md`
  - `PROJECT-SETUP-V5.0.md` → `CCGM_Prompt_ProjectSetup_v5.8.2.md`
  - `RESTART-V5.0.md` → `CCGM_Prompt_Restart_v5.8.2.md`
  - Format: `CCGM_Prompt_[Name]_v[VERSION].md`
  - Ensures users always know which CC_GodMode version the prompt belongs to

### Fixed

- **Parallel Gates Symbol** - v5.6.0 feature finally documented everywhere
  - All workflow diagrams now show `∥` for parallel @validator/@tester execution
  - Consistent with 40% faster validation introduced in v5.6.0
  - Fixed in all prompt files and workflow documentation

- **Report Paths** - Corrected to version-based structure
  - All references now point to `reports/v[VERSION]/` pattern
  - Aligns with v4.1.0 Version-First Workflow

### Documentation

  - Table overview of all 4 user-facing prompts
  - Clear guidance on when to use each prompt
  - All links updated to new filenames

- **CLAUDE.md** - Prompt File Naming Convention added
  - Documented as MANDATORY for all future updates
  - 5-step update process for version increments
  - Ensures consistency across all user-facing documentation

### Impact

- **User Experience**: No more confusion about prompt file versions
- **Maintenance**: Clear naming makes updates trackable
- **Consistency**: All prompts aligned with actual CC_GodMode version

## [5.8.0] - 2026-01-08

**"The Governance & Domain-Pack Release" - AI Systems That Know Their Limits**

> *In which the AI learns to make meta-decisions. After weeks of building features reactively, v5.8.0 introduces something revolutionary: the system now makes decisions about HOW to work before it starts working. Meta-decision logic analyzes every prompt and adapts the workflow accordingly. Security overrides? Check. Breaking change escalation? Automatic. Emergency hotfix bypass? Built-in. And with the Domain-Pack architecture, teams can now customize quality standards without forking the core. Like finally teaching the AI to "think about thinking," v5.8.0 represents the shift from mechanical execution to intelligent governance.*

### Added - Phase 2: Governance Features

- **Feature #1: Meta-Decision Logic** - Intelligent workflow adaptation
  - `scripts/analyze-prompt.js` enhanced with META_DECISION_LAYER
  - 5 Meta-Rules with automatic workflow modification:

### Added - Phase 3: Quality & Architecture Features

- **Feature #4: Abort/Escalation Mechanism** - Three-Tier Error Handling
  - `scripts/escalation-handler.js` (disabled by default, opt-in via `config/escalation-config.json`)
  - Three escalation tiers with automatic progression:
    - **Tier 1 (Agent Self-Resolution):** Agent retries task with modified approach (max 2 attempts)
    - **Tier 2 (Orchestrator Resolution):** Orchestrator reassigns to different agent or modifies workflow
    - **Tier 3 (Human Escalation):** Blocks workflow, creates GitHub issue, notifies user
  - Triggered by: agent timeout (>10min), repeated failures (3x), dependency deadlock, security violations
  - Logged to `reports/v[VERSION]/escalations.log` for post-mortem analysis
  - Non-blocking by default (opt-in design preserves system stability)
  - Prevents infinite retry loops that waste tokens and time

- **Feature #6: Domain-Specific Quality Gates** - Customizable Validation Rules
  - `scripts/validate-agent-output.js` extended with domain parameter support
  - CLI flag: `--domain=<domain-name>` (e.g., `--domain=e-commerce`, `--domain=healthcare`)

### Philosophy

*The Governance & Domain-Pack Release - AI Systems That Know Their Limits. Like teaching a teenager to "think before acting," v5.8.0 introduces meta-cognition to the workflow. The system now analyzes its own decision-making process and adapts accordingly. Security issue? Bypass normal workflow. Documentation change? Skip unnecessary gates. Breaking change? Add extra scrutiny. This isn't just automation—it's intelligent automation. And with the domain-pack architecture, teams can customize quality standards without forking the core. The AI is learning governance, one meta-decision at a time. Next up: Phase 4's testing enhancements will validate these governance decisions with even greater rigor. The loop keeps moving on—but now it's a smarter loop.* 🧠

## [5.7.0] - 2026-01-08

**"The Documentation & Standards Release" - Explicit Over Implicit**

> *In which the system learns to document its own rules. After years of implicit knowledge scattered across agent files, v5.7.0 says "Let's write this down properly." Three comprehensive policy documents now define what was previously tribal knowledge: how agents should format reports, what's in their scope, and which tools they can touch. Like finally writing down your grandmother's secret recipe instead of just "eyeballing it," these standards transform implicit patterns into explicit contracts. Revolutionary? For an AI system trying to manage itself, absolutely.*

### Philosophy

*The Documentation & Standards Release - Where implicit becomes explicit. Like the difference between "knowing" how to ride a bike and being able to write a manual about it, v5.7.0 Phase 1 transforms the CC_GodMode system's tacit knowledge into formal documentation. Three comprehensive policy documents now serve as the single source of truth for agent behavior, tool access, and report formatting. No more "just read the code" - now it's "read the policy." The AI is learning to be its own technical writer, and the results are surprisingly organized. Next up: Phase 2's hook enhancements will put these policies into automated enforcement. The loop keeps moving on - but now it has a proper operations manual.*

## [5.4.1] - 2026-01-07

**"The Synchronization Fix"**

> *In which the system learns to keep its promises consistent. A critical agent configuration mismatch threatened deployment integrity - now resolved with bulletproof synchronization.*

### Fixed

- **CRITICAL: @architect Agent Configuration Synchronized** - Issue #1 Resolution
  - Added Write + Bash tool access to @architect for autonomous report creation
  - Fixed local repository / global runtime configuration mismatch (DEPLOYMENT BLOCKER)
  - Resolves: "No such tool available: Bash" error that blocked all workflows
  - Maintains proper role boundaries: Write for reports only, no Edit access
  - Validated with dual quality gates: @validator (91%) + @tester (100% UX)

### Technical

- **Agent Configuration Integrity**
  - Local `agents/architect.md` synchronized with global `~/.claude/agents/architect.md`
  - Tool access: Read, Write, Bash, Grep, Glob, WebFetch (was missing Write + Bash)
  - Enhanced documentation with Tool Usage Guidelines
  - Prevents deployment failures and ensures fix persistence across installations

### Quality Assurance

- **Comprehensive System Validation**
  - @validator: Complete agent configuration audit, security assessment, regression testing
  - @tester: End-to-end UX validation, performance benchmarking, accessibility compliance (WCAG 2.1 AA)
  - Both quality gates: APPROVED with bulletproof deployment safety verification

### Philosophy

*The system's evolution toward self-consistency accelerates. Where before local and global configurations could drift apart silently, the dual quality gate system now catches such discrepancies immediately. A small synchronization fix today prevents widespread deployment failures tomorrow - another step toward truly reliable self-managing AI systems.*

---

## [5.4.0] - 2026-01-07
