## [5.3.0] - 2026-01-07

**"The Self-Improvement Release"**

> *In which the system uses its own agents to fix bugs in its own agents. The experiment continues.*

### Fixed

- **Agent Tool Mismatch Bug (Complete Resolution)** - architect.md and scribe.md no longer attempt unavailable Bash operations
  - Previously: Both agents had instructions containing `cat`, `git`, `tail`, `npx` commands despite lacking Bash tool access
  - Solution: Replaced all Bash commands with "REQUEST TO ORCHESTRATOR" delegation pattern
  - `architect.md` - "Dependency Check" section now asks Orchestrator to run commands
  - `scribe.md` - "Version Management" and "Quick Commands" sections now use delegation
  - Clear pattern established: Agents with Read/Grep/Glob tools delegate system operations to Orchestrator
  - No more hanging when agents hit tool boundaries

### Added

- **Hook Timeout Configuration** - PostToolUse hook now includes explicit timeout
  - Added `timeout: 30` to prevent indefinite hanging on API guardian checks
  - Ensures graceful failure if hook script becomes unresponsive
  - Part of system robustness improvements

- **Agent Architecture Documentation** - README.md now explains dual-location model
  - Clarifies source vs. runtime distinction
  - `/agents/` = Git repository (source of truth, versioned)
  - `~/.claude/agents/` = Runtime location (installed, globally available)
  - Installation syncs source → runtime
  - Addresses common confusion about "where do agents live?"

### Technical

- **Meta-Engineering Achievement** - CC_GodMode successfully used its own workflow to improve itself
  - @validator detected tool mismatches in @architect and @scribe
  - @builder implemented fixes using delegation pattern
  - @validator confirmed fixes resolved the issues
  - Full dogfooding: The tool that builds itself

### Breaking Changes

None - This is a bugfix and documentation release.
