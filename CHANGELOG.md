cp agents/github-manager.md ~/.claude/agents/
```

### 2. Install MCP Servers

# Run the installation script
chmod +x scripts/install-mcps.sh
./scripts/install-mcps.sh

# Or manually:
claude mcp add playwright -- npx @playwright/mcp@latest
claude mcp add lighthouse -- npx lighthouse-mcp
claude mcp add a11y -- npx a11y-mcp

# For GitHub MCP (requires Docker + token)
export GITHUB_TOKEN="your_token"
claude mcp add github -e GITHUB_PERSONAL_ACCESS_TOKEN=$GITHUB_TOKEN -- docker run -i --rm -e GITHUB_PERSONAL_ACCESS_TOKEN ghcr.io/github/github-mcp-server
```

### 3. Install Playwright Browsers

```bash
